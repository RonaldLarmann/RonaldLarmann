      <description>&lt;p&gt;In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like it’s heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A paragraph looks like this — Globally incubate standards compliant channels before scalable benefits. Quickly disseminate superior deliverables whereas web-enabled applications. Quickly drive clicks-and-mortar catalysts for change before vertical architectures. Credibly reintermediate backend ideas for cross-platform models. Continually reintermediate integrated processes through technically sound intellectual capital. Holistically foster superior methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;headings-by-default&#34;&gt;Headings by default:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;h1-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H1 Default styles for headings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;h2-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H2 Default styles for headings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;h3-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H3 Default styles for headings&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;h4-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H4 Default styles for headings&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;h5 id=&#34;h5-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H5 Default styles for headings&lt;/h5&gt;&#xA;&lt;h6 id=&#34;h6-default-styles-for-headings&#34;&gt;H6 Default styles for headings&lt;/h6&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lists&#34;&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;ordered-list-example&#34;&gt;Ordered list example:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Poutine drinking vinegar bitters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coloring book distillery fanny pack.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Venmo biodiesel gentrify enamel pin meditation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jean shorts shaman listicle pickled portland.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Salvia mumblecore brunch iPhone migas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;unordered-list-example&#34;&gt;Unordered list example:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bitters semiotics vice thundercats synth.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Literally cred narwhal bitters wayfarers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kale chips chartreuse paleo tbh street art marfa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mlkshk polaroid sriracha brooklyn.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pug you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of them air plant man bun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;table&#34;&gt;Table&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;table-container&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;table&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 3&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 4&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Header 5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:1 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:2 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:3 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:4 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:5 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row:6 Cell:5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quotes&#34;&gt;Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-quote-looks-like-this&#34;&gt;A quote looks like this:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
